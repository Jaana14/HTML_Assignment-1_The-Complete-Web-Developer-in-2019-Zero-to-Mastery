	<p>Hello everyone. I am Ana. I want to be a developer in 2019. For me, the world made of codes represents a great combination of fun and work. My adventure began a few months ago on the<a href="https://www.sololearn.com/"> Sololearn </a> website. Here I learned the basics of HTML, CSS and Java Script. Then I continued to self-study with the help of <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">Free Code Camp</a> and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3 school</a>. But I still missed something that would finally give it whole. Now finally I found it on the site <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a>, on course <a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery/">The complete web developer zero to mastery<a></p><br>
		<p>And these are the things that are needed for my perfect day</p>
